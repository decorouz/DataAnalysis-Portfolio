## Business Task
Determine how annual members and casual rider use Cyclistic differently.

## Data Source
* **Data Source:** Public data provided by Motivate International Inc.(Divvy bike share system across Chicago and Evanston) under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
* [Download Cyclistic trip history data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
* The data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system; and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure)
* Each trip is anonymized and includes:
    * Trip start day and time
    * Trip end day and time
    * Trip start station
    * Trip end station
    * Rider type (Member, Single Ride, and Day Pass)
* **Date range**: September 2021 to September 2022
* Download the data to local storage

## Cleaning, Processing and Manipulation of Data
* Extract data from zip file on local storage
* Load data to a data store (Google Cloud Storage).
* Data imported from Google Cloud Storage into BigQuery to explore, profile, clean, shape and analyze data using SQL.
* SQL in BigQuery is the tool adopted for this analysis because of the size of the data and need to create quick visualization.
* Create a new variable/column `ride_duration_second` to calculate the duration of each ride by subtracting the column `started_at` from the column `ended_at` and format in second.
* Create a new variable/column `ride_distance` to calculate the distance of each ride by using spatial relation functions `ST_GEOGPOINT`, `ST_DISTANCE` on the `start_lgn` `start_lat`, and `end_lng`, `end_lat`.
* Profile the day name of the `start_at` timestamp as `start_day`.
* A new permanent table with all the data and calculated columns is generated with this [query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/uncleaned_divydata.sql)
* `6,584,382` rows is generated by requires cleaning


* **Cleaning Process**:
    - Rename downloaded file to ensure filename consistence 
    - Duplicate checked using [this query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/duplicate_check.sql)
    - Check for missing or `NULL` values using [this query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/columns_check.sql). `1,489,091` rows contain missing/NULL values. 
    - The `start_station_name`, `start_station_id`, `end_station_name`, `end_station_id` columns are found to be only sources of missing value using [this query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/check_null.sql).
    - Using [this query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/check_null.sql) `start_station_name` and `end_station_name` is found to account for `15.01%` and `16.06%` of the missing value respectively.
    - The electric bike type is found to have `31.33%` missing `start_station_name` values compared to the zero percent for other bike types using [this query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/check_null.sql)

>**Missing Data Strategy:** The dataset contains `1,489,091` records with missing values. This amount to `16%` of the entire dataset. A [litewise deletion](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2017/09/4-methods-missing-data/) strategy is adopted because we do still have sufficient data to perform the analysis. Also the variables that contains the missing values are not important in deriving insight per the business task under investigation.

>> Cleaning and merging of the data into one table is consolidated using this [query](https://github.com/decorouz/DataAnalysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic-Case/clean_single_query.sql). `5,094,974` rows were returned for proceeding to analysis.
